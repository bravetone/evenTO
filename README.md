###### BIG CHANGES
I changed the whole file structure. Now, everything is inside `website`.
To get everything working well, left click to the website and from "mark directory as" pick sources root. For the `templates` folder inside do pick "templates folder".

* Errors appear if something is wrong.
* Post an event appears if we are logged in
* Error message appears but breadcrumbs disappear  
* run.py is used for running (ofkors)
* routes.py are for routes
